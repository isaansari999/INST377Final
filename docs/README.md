# Dog Breed Picker - Discovering Dog Breeds

## Created by Isa Ansari

## Project Description

Dog Breed Picker is a full functioning web application with front and back-end setup. Users can browse, learn about, and enjoy pictures of various dog breeds through the interface. Designed for leisurely dog viewers, or any other dog "enthusiasts" that may need pictures of various breeds for any reason, the site utilizes real-time APIs and a custom database to display and track user-selected breeds. 

The website's intended browser is primarily for desktop. Whether it be Firefox, Google Chrome, or any other desktop browser of choice.
